=== Address Register
The address register is a register that has the capability of incrementing and decrementing without the use of the ALU. Unlike the GPRs the address registers do not have access to the X and Y bus however they do have access to the address bus. The address registers can read and rewrite from the data bus and write to the address bus.

== Register Control

Seven control signals control the operation of the address register.

[cols="1h,1,3", width=75%]
|===
| d_bus_read | Active high
| Read the contents of the data bus into the register latch

| d_bus_write | Active high
| Write the contents of the register latch onto the data bus

| a_bus_write | Active high
| Write the contents of the register latch onto the address bus

| reg_inc | Active high
| Increment the register by one

| reg_dec | Active high
| Decrement the register by one

| reg_carry | Active high
| This line is high if the counter performed a carry in the previous increment/decrement operation

| reg_borrow | Active high
| This line is high if the counter performed a borrow in the previous increment/decrement operation

=== Notes

* Breadboard controls (R-L)
** d_bus_read
** d_bus_write
** a_bus_write
** inc
** dec
** carry
** borrow
* While counting down or up the other should be held high
* If not the counter will not work
* Held high via pull up resistor in case of floating input
* On reset set to known state (important for PC)
* On the breadboard the address register 74LS193 is very sensitive to address and data bus levels and pull down resistors must be used on the buses.
