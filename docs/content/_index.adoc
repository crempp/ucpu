This is a 16bit pipelined CPU built to be used for experimentation, programming and fun. The CPU is was designed on a breadboard and produced on PCBs in modular architecture utilizing a flexible backplane for expansion and upgrades.

The objective of the µCPU project is to learn electronics, CPU design and build a fully functional CPU that can be updated, added to and further developed easily.

The completed project will include 32 Kb ROM, 32 Kb RAM, a pipelined core, serial port, cartridge support,  VGA compatible video, stereo multi voice sound and more.

****

The CPU is being targeted at approximately the PC AT (286) level or Super Nintendo

* Four general purpose 16 bit registers (A, B, C, D)
* Four 16 bit address registers (PC, SP, SI, DI)
* ALU supporting addition, subtraction, shift and bitwise operations
* Pipelined instructions
* Clock runs at 4Mhz
* Banked memory with a base of 32 Kb ROM and 32 Kb RAM, expandable to  304 Kb RAM
* 4 I/O ports for testing and expansion
* Serial port
* 64k Video memory supporting
    * 320×200 in 256 colors
    * 640x350 in 4 (or 16???) colors
* Sprite and effect processing (details TBD)
* Stereo multi-voice sound (details TBD)
* A custom bootable OS
* A BASIC interpreter (ROM)
* Drive support (SD interface to start with)
* Cartridge support (ROMs)

After the CPU is working I may add

* DMA
* ... more?
