This is a 16bit pipelined CPU designed on a breadboard and produced in modular component boards.

My objective in this project is to learn electronics, CPU design and build a fully functional CPU that can be updated, added to and further developed easily.

The CPU is designed around
* four general purpose 16 bit registers
* four 16 bit address registers
* ALU supporting addition, subtraction, shift and bitwise operations
* piplined instructions
* banked memory with a base of 64k, expandable to about 1.5 megabytes (max TBD)
